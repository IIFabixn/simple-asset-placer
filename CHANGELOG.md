# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-04

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Asset Cycling System
- **Cycle Through Assets During Placement**: Press `]` or `[` to browse assets without leaving the viewport
  - **Next Asset**: Press `]` (BRACKETRIGHT) to cycle forward through visible assets
  - **Previous Asset**: Press `[` (BRACKETLEFT) to cycle backward through visible assets
  - **Tap to Cycle Once**: Quick press cycles to next/previous asset
  - **Hold to Rapid Cycle**: Hold key to quickly browse through multiple assets (150ms repeat rate)

  - **Auto-Scroll**: Browser automatically scrolls to keep selected asset visible
  - **Visual Feedback**: Thumbnail highlights and preview updates instantly
  - **Works with Both Tabs**: Supports 3D Models and MeshLibrary browsers
  - **Wrap-Around**: Seamlessly loops from last asset back to first

#### Cycling Configuration
- Added "Cycle Next Asset" keybind in Settings ‚Üí Control Keys
- Added "Cycle Previous Asset" keybind in Settings ‚Üí Control Keys

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-04

### üîß Architecture & Bug Fixes

#### Offset-Based Architecture Refactor
- **RotationManager**: Complete refactor to use offset-based system instead of absolute rotations
  - Renamed `current_rotation` ‚Üí `manual_rotation_offset` (breaking change for internal API)
  - Renamed `set_rotation()` ‚Üí `set_rotation_offset()`
  - Renamed `get_rotation()` ‚Üí `get_rotation_offset()`
  - Renamed `get_rotation_degrees()` ‚Üí `get_rotation_offset_degrees()`
  - Now preserves original node rotations when entering transform mode
  - Updated `apply_rotation_to_node()` to accept `original_rotation` parameter
  - Rotation formula: `final_rotation = original_rotation + surface_alignment + manual_offset`
  - All rotation operations (rotate_x, rotate_y, rotate_z) now modify offset instead of absolute rotation
  
- **ScaleManager**: Complete refactor to use multiplier-based system instead of absolute scales
  - Renamed `current_scale` ‚Üí `scale_multiplier` (breaking change for internal API)
  - Renamed `non_uniform_scale` ‚Üí `non_uniform_multiplier`
  - Renamed `set_scale()` ‚Üí `set_scale_multiplier()`
  - Renamed `get_scale()` ‚Üí `get_scale_multiplier()`
  - Now preserves original node scales when entering transform mode
  - Updated `apply_scale_to_node()` and `apply_uniform_scale_to_node()` to accept `original_scale` parameter
  - Scale formula: `final_scale = original_scale * scale_multiplier`

#### Transform Mode Improvements
- **Fixed critical bug**: Node rotations no longer reset to zero when entering transform mode with multiple nodes
- **Group rotation**: Implemented rotation around collective center while preserving individual node rotations
  - Each node orbits the group center while maintaining its own rotation offset
  - Uses rotation basis calculation: `rotation_basis * original_offset` for proper orbital motion
- **Position updates**: Eliminated `initial_frame` workaround for cleaner logic
  - `snap_offset` now calculated once at mode start for consistent positioning
  - Simplified flow: `new_center = mouse_center + snap_offset + accumulated_delta`
- **Original transforms**: All original transforms (position, rotation, scale) now stored in `original_transforms` dictionary at mode start
- Unified transform application flow with consistent offset-based approach

#### Visual Improvements
- **Thumbnail camera angle**: Adjusted from `Vector3(1, 0.7, 1)` to `Vector3(1, 1, -1)` (frontal-diagonal view)
- Increased camera padding from 1.5x to 2x for better framing
- Thumbnails now show frontal view of assets for better preview quality and identification

#### Stability & Compatibility
- **Removed Terrain3D plugin**: Completely removed Terrain3D addon to prevent conflicts
  - Deleted 169 files including binaries, brushes, icons, tools, and utilities
  - Cleaned up sample scenes and terrain data
  - Updated `project.godot` to disable terrain_3d plugin
- Added Terrain3D usage tip in README for users who want to use it separately

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements
- **Unified architecture**: All transformation managers now use consistent offset-based calculations
- **Better encapsulation**: Original node values preserved and never directly modified
- **Cleaner code**: Removed workarounds and simplified logic flows
- **Improved maintainability**: Consistent naming conventions across all managers
- **Better separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between original values, offsets, and final transforms
