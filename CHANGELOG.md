  - Grid offset values now correctly update the `snap_offset` variable when changed in the UI
  - Snapping now properly offsets from world origin (e.g., 0.5 offset results in snapping to -6.5, -1.5 instead of -6.0, -1.0)
- **Grid Offset Settings Persistence**: Fixed grid offset values not loading on plugin startup
  - Added `update_ui_from_settings()` call in `_ready()` to apply loaded settings to UI controls

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-05

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Hold-to-Repeat System
- **Continuous Actions While Holding Keys**: Hold transformation keys to repeatedly apply actions
  - **Grace Period**: 150ms delay before repeat starts (preserves tap behavior for mouse wheel combos)
  - **Smart Repeat Intervals**: Optimized for each action type
    - Rotation: 100ms (responsive rotation)
    - Scale: 80ms (smooth scaling)
    - Height: 80ms (smooth vertical adjustment)
    - Position: 50ms (smooth WASD movement)
  - **Supported Keys**: Works with all transformation keys (X/Y/Z rotation, Q/E height, WASD position, PageUp/Down scale)
  - **Single Action Priority**: Only one action repeats at a time (pressing new key cancels previous)
  - **Modifier Change Detection**: Pressing/releasing SHIFT or ALT during repeat cancels it
  - **Wheel Interruption**: Using mouse wheel interrupts repeat and requires key re-press
  - **Tap Behavior Preserved**: Quick press (< 150ms) still performs single action for wheel combos

### üêõ Fixed
- **Grid Overlay Coordinate System**: Fixed grid overlay moving in opposite direction when transforming nodes
  - Root cause: Grid was inheriting flipped coordinate system from scene root nodes with 180¬∞ Y-axis rotation
  - Solution: Set `top_level = true` on grid overlay to make it independent of parent transform
  - Grid now works correctly regardless of scene root rotation or transform
  - Both XZ plane movement and Y-axis height adjustments now follow object correctly
- **Random Y-Rotation Now Works**: Fixed broken random rotation feature - settings were being passed but never applied during placement
  - Added random rotation application in `utility_manager.gd` for all three placement functions (place_asset_in_scene, place_meshlib_item_in_scene, place_mesh_in_scene)
  - Random rotation now applies AFTER manual rotation offsets, giving full 0-360 degree randomization on Y-axis
- **Hardcoded Modifier Keys**: Fixed all remaining hardcoded CTRL/SHIFT/ALT key references
  - Added new configurable `fine_increment_modifier_key` setting (default: CTRL)
  - Removed all hardcoded `ctrl_held` checks throughout codebase
  - TransformationManager now uses `fine_increment_modifier_held` for grid snapping half-step mode
  - Updated fine increment detection for height adjustments (placement and transform modes)
  - Updated fine increment detection for WASD position adjustments (placement and transform modes)
  - Updated rotation increment logic to use `fine_increment_modifier_held` instead of hardcoded CTRL
  - All modifier keys now fully configurable: Reverse Direction, Large Increment, and Fine Increment
  - Users can now bind all modifiers to any key combination

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements
- **InputHandler Enhancements**:
  - Added `is_action_key_held_with_repeat()` function with comprehensive state tracking
  - New tracking variables: `active_repeat_key`, `active_repeat_modifiers`, `wheel_interrupted_keys`, `repeat_intervals`
  - Modifier tracking now uses all three configured modifier keys (`reverse_modifier_key`, `large_increment_modifier_key`, `fine_increment_modifier_key`)
  - Added `is_fine_increment_modifier_held()` helper function for half-step detection
  - Wheel interruption detection automatically flags held keys when wheel is used
  - Automatic cleanup on key release (clears interruption flags and repeat state)
- **Input Query Functions Updated**:
  - `get_rotation_input()`: X/Y/Z keys support hold-to-repeat
  - `get_scale_input()`: PageUp/Down keys support hold-to-repeat
  - `get_position_input()`: Q/E (height) and WASD (position) keys support hold-to-repeat, added `fine_increment_modifier_held` field
- **Settings System**:
  - Added "Fine Increment" modifier key configuration in Settings ‚Üí Modifier Keys
  - All three modifier keys now fully configurable: Reverse Direction (SHIFT), Large Increment (ALT), Fine Increment (CTRL)
  - UI controls for fine increment modifier key binding with key capture support

- **Modifier-Only Combinations**: Fixed capturing modifier-only combinations like CTRL+ALT without requiring a base key
- **Key Chord Recording**: Improved key binding capture to record all pressed keys and capture complete combinations on release
- **Modifier Key Recognition**: Fixed issue where modifier keys were not being recognized during gameplay (rotation, scale, height adjustments)
- **Configurable Modifiers in Transformation Manager**: Updated all transformation logic to use configurable modifier keys instead of hardcoded SHIFT/ALT
- **Input Dictionary Completeness**: Added missing `reverse_modifier_held` field to scale input dictionary

### üîß Improved
- **Key Binding Capture Logic**: Redesigned to use a recording approach that tracks all pressed keys and captures on complete release
