## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-05

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Hold-to-Repeat System
- **Continuous Actions While Holding Keys**: Hold transformation keys to repeatedly apply actions
  - **Grace Period**: 150ms delay before repeat starts (preserves tap behavior for mouse wheel combos)
  - **Smart Repeat Intervals**: Optimized for each action type
    - Rotation: 100ms (responsive rotation)
    - Scale: 80ms (smooth scaling)
    - Height: 80ms (smooth vertical adjustment)
    - Position: 50ms (smooth WASD movement)

  - **Wheel Interruption**: Using mouse wheel interrupts repeat and requires key re-press
  - **Tap Behavior Preserved**: Quick press (< 150ms) still performs single action for wheel combos

### üêõ Fixed
- **Grid Overlay Coordinate System**: Fixed grid overlay moving in opposite direction when transforming nodes
  - Root cause: Grid was inheriting flipped coordinate system from scene root nodes with 180¬∞ Y-axis rotation
  - Solution: Set `top_level = true` on grid overlay to make it independent of parent transform
  - Grid now works correctly regardless of scene root rotation or transform
  - Both XZ plane movement and Y-axis height adjustments now follow object correctly
- **Random Y-Rotation Now Works**: Fixed broken random rotation feature - settings were being passed but never applied during placement
  - Added random rotation application in `utility_manager.gd` for all three placement functions (place_asset_in_scene, place_meshlib_item_in_scene, place_mesh_in_scene)
  - Random rotation now applies AFTER manual rotation offsets, giving full 0-360 degree randomization on Y-axis

  - Added new configurable `fine_increment_modifier_key` setting (default: CTRL)
  - Removed all hardcoded `ctrl_held` checks throughout codebase

- **Input Dictionary Completeness**: Added missing `reverse_modifier_held` field to scale input dictionary

### üîß Improved
- **Key Binding Capture Logic**: Redesigned to use a recording approach that tracks all pressed keys and captures on complete release
- **Action Key Detection**: Action keys (Y, X, Z, Q, E, etc.) now properly detected even when modifiers are held
- **Modifier Separation**: Modifier state checks are now independent from action key detection, allowing proper combinations like SHIFT+Y for reverse rotation
