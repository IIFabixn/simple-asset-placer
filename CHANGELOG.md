# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-05

### ✨ New Features

#### Hold-to-Repeat System
- **Continuous Actions While Holding Keys**: Hold transformation keys to repeatedly apply actions
  - **Grace Period**: 150ms delay before repeat starts (preserves tap behavior for mouse wheel combos)
  - **Smart Repeat Intervals**: Optimized for each action type
    - Rotation: 100ms (responsive rotation)
    - Scale: 80ms (smooth scaling)
    - Height: 80ms (smooth vertical adjustment)
    - Position: 50ms (smooth WASD movement)
  - **Supported Keys**: Works with all transformation keys (X/Y/Z rotation, Q/E height, WASD position, PageUp/Down scale)
  - **Single Action Priority**: Only one action repeats at a time (pressing new key cancels previous)
  - **Modifier Change Detection**: Pressing/releasing SHIFT or ALT during repeat cancels it
  - **Wheel Interruption**: Using mouse wheel interrupts repeat and requires key re-press
  - **Tap Behavior Preserved**: Quick press (< 150ms) still performs single action for wheel combos

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Grid Overlay Coordinate System**: Fixed grid overlay moving in opposite direction when transforming nodes
  - Root cause: Grid was inheriting flipped coordinate system from scene root nodes with 180° Y-axis rotation
  - Solution: Set `top_level = true` on grid overlay to make it independent of parent transform
  - Grid now works correctly regardless of scene root rotation or transform
  - Both XZ plane movement and Y-axis height adjustments now follow object correctly
- **Random Y-Rotation Now Works**: Fixed broken random rotation feature - settings were being passed but never applied during placement
  - Added random rotation application in `utility_manager.gd` for all three placement functions (place_asset_in_scene, place_meshlib_item_in_scene, place_mesh_in_scene)
  - Random rotation now applies AFTER manual rotation offsets, giving full 0-360 degree randomization on Y-axis
- **Hardcoded Modifier Keys**: Fixed all remaining hardcoded CTRL/SHIFT/ALT key references
  - Added new configurable `fine_increment_modifier_key` setting (default: CTRL)
  - Removed all hardcoded `ctrl_held` checks throughout codebase
  - TransformationManager now uses `fine_increment_modifier_held` for grid snapping half-step mode
  - Updated fine increment detection for height adjustments (placement and transform modes)
  - Updated fine increment detection for WASD position adjustments (placement and transform modes)
  - Updated rotation increment logic to use `fine_increment_modifier_held` instead of hardcoded CTRL
  - All modifier keys now fully configurable: Reverse Direction, Large Increment, and Fine Increment
  - Users can now bind all modifiers to any key combination

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
- **InputHandler Enhancements**:
  - Added `is_action_key_held_with_repeat()` function with comprehensive state tracking
  - New tracking variables: `active_repeat_key`, `active_repeat_modifiers`, `wheel_interrupted_keys`, `repeat_intervals`
  - Modifier tracking now uses all three configured modifier keys (`reverse_modifier_key`, `large_increment_modifier_key`, `fine_increment_modifier_key`)
  - Added `is_fine_increment_modifier_held()` helper function for half-step detection
  - Wheel interruption detection automatically flags held keys when wheel is used
  - Automatic cleanup on key release (clears interruption flags and repeat state)
- **Input Query Functions Updated**:
  - `get_rotation_input()`: X/Y/Z keys support hold-to-repeat
  - `get_scale_input()`: PageUp/Down keys support hold-to-repeat
  - `get_position_input()`: Q/E (height) and WASD (position) keys support hold-to-repeat, added `fine_increment_modifier_held` field
- **Settings System**:
  - Added "Fine Increment" modifier key configuration in Settings → Modifier Keys
  - All three modifier keys now fully configurable: Reverse Direction (SHIFT), Large Increment (ALT), Fine Increment (CTRL)
  - UI controls for fine increment modifier key binding with key capture support
  - Settings persist across sessions via EditorSettings

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-04

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Pure Modifier Key Bindings**: Fixed support for binding pure modifiers (ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, META) to modifier keys (Large Increment, Reverse Direction)
- **Modifier-Only Combinations**: Fixed capturing modifier-only combinations like CTRL+ALT without requiring a base key
- **Key Chord Recording**: Improved key binding capture to record all pressed keys and capture complete combinations on release
- **Modifier Key Recognition**: Fixed issue where modifier keys were not being recognized during gameplay (rotation, scale, height adjustments)
- **Configurable Modifiers in Transformation Manager**: Updated all transformation logic to use configurable modifier keys instead of hardcoded SHIFT/ALT
- **Input Dictionary Completeness**: Added missing `reverse_modifier_held` field to scale input dictionary

### 🔧 Improved
- **Key Binding Capture Logic**: Redesigned to use a recording approach that tracks all pressed keys and captures on complete release
- **Action Key Detection**: Action keys (Y, X, Z, Q, E, etc.) now properly detected even when modifiers are held
- **Modifier Separation**: Modifier state checks are now independent from action key detection, allowing proper combinations like SHIFT+Y for reverse rotation

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-04

### 🔧 Architecture & Bug Fixes

#### Offset-Based Architecture Refactor
- **RotationManager**: Complete refactor to use offset-based system instead of absolute rotations
  - Renamed `current_rotation` → `manual_rotation_offset` (breaking change for internal API)
  - Renamed `set_rotation()` → `set_rotation_offset()`
  - Renamed `get_rotation()` → `get_rotation_offset()`
  - Renamed `get_rotation_degrees()` → `get_rotation_offset_degrees()`
  - Now preserves original node rotations when entering transform mode
  - Updated `apply_rotation_to_node()` to accept `original_rotation` parameter
  - Rotation formula: `final_rotation = original_rotation + surface_alignment + manual_offset`
  - All rotation operations (rotate_x, rotate_y, rotate_z) now modify offset instead of absolute rotation
  
- **ScaleManager**: Complete refactor to use multiplier-based system instead of absolute scales
  - Renamed `current_scale` → `scale_multiplier` (breaking change for internal API)
  - Renamed `non_uniform_scale` → `non_uniform_multiplier`
  - Renamed `set_scale()` → `set_scale_multiplier()`
  - Renamed `get_scale()` → `get_scale_multiplier()`
  - Now preserves original node scales when entering transform mode
  - Updated `apply_scale_to_node()` and `apply_uniform_scale_to_node()` to accept `original_scale` parameter
  - Scale formula: `final_scale = original_scale * scale_multiplier`

#### Transform Mode Improvements
- **Fixed critical bug**: Node rotations no longer reset to zero when entering transform mode with multiple nodes
- **Group rotation**: Implemented rotation around collective center while preserving individual node rotations
  - Each node orbits the group center while maintaining its own rotation offset
  - Uses rotation basis calculation: `rotation_basis * original_offset` for proper orbital motion
- **Position updates**: Eliminated `initial_frame` workaround for cleaner logic
  - `snap_offset` now calculated once at mode start for consistent positioning
  - Simplified flow: `new_center = mouse_center + snap_offset + accumulated_delta`
- **Original transforms**: All original transforms (position, rotation, scale) now stored in `original_transforms` dictionary at mode start
- Unified transform application flow with consistent offset-based approach

#### Visual Improvements
- **Thumbnail camera angle**: Adjusted from `Vector3(1, 0.7, 1)` to `Vector3(1, 1, -1)` (frontal-diagonal view)
- Increased camera padding from 1.5x to 2x for better framing
- Thumbnails now show frontal view of assets for better preview quality and identification

#### Stability & Compatibility
- **Removed Terrain3D plugin**: Completely removed Terrain3D addon to prevent conflicts
  - Deleted 169 files including binaries, brushes, icons, tools, and utilities
  - Cleaned up sample scenes and terrain data
  - Updated `project.godot` to disable terrain_3d plugin
- Added Terrain3D usage tip in README for users who want to use it separately

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
- **Unified architecture**: All transformation managers now use consistent offset-based calculations
- **Better encapsulation**: Original node values preserved and never directly modified
- **Cleaner code**: Removed workarounds and simplified logic flows
- **Improved maintainability**: Consistent naming conventions across all managers
- **Better separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between original values, offsets, and final transforms
